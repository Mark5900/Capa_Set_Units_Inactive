# Capa_Set_Units_Inactive

PowerShell script to set units inactive in CapaInstaller Console after x-days where the agen haven't executed and moves the units to a folder specified by the parameter `$Script:InactiveFolderStructure`.

If the parameter `$Script:InactiveActiveFolderStructure` in not `$null` units who wil become active again will be moved to the folder specified by the parameter `$Script:InactiveActiveFolderStructure`.

If the parameter `$Script:InactiveLastRunTimeFolderStructure` is not `$null`, units who have not executed for x-days but have newer run time than x-days will be moved to the folder specified by the parameter `$Script:InactiveLastRunTimeFolderStructure`. A little "good bug" is if you have multiple units with the same name, after x-days where one of the units have not executed, both units will be moved to the folder specified by the parameter.
